# NSAIDs in Chemical Occurrence Database (EMPODAT)

This repository contains the dataset, supplementary analysis and visualization files supporting the manuscript "Regulatory aspects of risks posed by veterinary medicinal products to European necrophagous birds: a case study with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)".

The aim of this repo is to provide all files that were used to:
- process NSAID concentration data across countries,
- generate interactive geo-maps of mean concentrations for each compound,
- provide summary statistics per sample matrix,
- and host HTML results for visualization.
